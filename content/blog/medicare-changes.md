## Medicare Made Simple

Medicare can be confusing, but understanding your coverage is essential for managing healthcare costs and getting the care you need.

## Key 2024 Changes

### Part B Premium
The standard Part B premium for 2024 is $174.70 per month. This is a modest increase from 2023.

### Part D Drug Coverage
The Inflation Reduction Act has capped out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per year—a huge win for many seniors on multiple medications.

### Preventive Care
Medicare now covers more preventive services at no cost, including certain cancer screenings and vaccinations.
