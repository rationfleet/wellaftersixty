## Moving Without Pain

Joint pain doesn't have to mean giving up on exercise. In fact, the right movements can actually help reduce pain and improve mobility over time.

## Why Low-Impact Exercise Matters

High-impact activities like running or jumping put stress on your joints. Low-impact exercises provide the benefits of movement without the jarring forces that can aggravate arthritis and other joint conditions.

## Top Low-Impact Exercises

### 1. Swimming and Water Aerobics
Water supports your body weight, reducing stress on joints by up to 90%. Plus, water resistance provides an excellent workout.

### 2. Tai Chi
This ancient Chinese practice combines gentle movements with deep breathing. Studies show it improves balance and reduces arthritis pain.

### 3. Cycling (Stationary or Outdoor)
Cycling strengthens leg muscles without impact. Start with a recumbent bike if balance is a concern.

### 4. Walking
Simple but effective. Start with short distances and gradually increase. Use supportive shoes and avoid uneven terrain.

### 5. Chair Yoga
Get the benefits of yoga while seated. Improves flexibility, reduces stiffness, and requires no equipment.

## Tips for Exercising with Joint Pain

- **Warm up first** - 5-10 minutes of gentle movement
- **Listen to your body** - Pain is a signal to stop
- **Stay consistent** - Regular, gentle exercise beats occasional intense workouts
- **Consider physical therapy** - A therapist can create a personalized plan

## The Bottom Line

Movement is medicine. Start slow, stay consistent, and you'll likely find that exercise helps more than it hurts.

*Consult your doctor before starting any new exercise program.*
