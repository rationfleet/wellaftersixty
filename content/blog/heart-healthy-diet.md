## Eating for Heart Health

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for adults over 60. But here's the empowering truth: **what you eat directly impacts your heart health**.

## The Mediterranean Diet: Gold Standard

The Mediterranean diet consistently ranks as one of the best diets for heart health. It emphasizes:

- **Olive oil** as the primary fat source
- **Plenty of vegetables** and fruits
- **Whole grains** like whole wheat, oats, and brown rice
- **Lean proteins** including fish and legumes
- **Limited red meat** and processed foods

## Foods That Love Your Heart

### Include More:
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) - 2 times per week
- Nuts and seeds (a small handful daily)
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Berries (blueberries, strawberries)
- Oatmeal and whole grains

### Limit These:
- Sodium (less than 2,300mg daily)
- Added sugars
- Saturated fats
- Processed meats

## A Sample Day of Heart-Healthy Eating

**Breakfast**: Oatmeal with walnuts and blueberries

**Lunch**: Mediterranean salad with chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumber, and olive oil dressing

**Dinner**: Baked salmon with roasted vegetables and quinoa

**Snacks**: Apple with almond butter, or a small handful of mixed nuts

## Making the Transition

Don't try to change everything at once. Start with one meal and gradually incorporate more heart-healthy choices. Your heart will thank you!
